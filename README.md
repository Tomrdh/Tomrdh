# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a simple theme and website developer. Some people call me Tom, but these are only my first 3 letters I used for URLs and I won't change it to avoid a lot of 404's.

## Pinned repositories ðŸ“Œ

### [Discord Addons](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons) (discord-addons)
Interesting themes and mini-themes for your Discord client. Supports Browser (using Stylus) and Discord (using a client mod like BetterDiscord). **[View Website](https://tomrdh.github.io/da-website/main)**

### [Main Website](https://tomrdh.github.io/main-page) (Tomrdh.github.io)
CURRENTLY CLOSED. This is my main website where I stock almost all my stuff. You can navigate on pages like you do to navigate on Discord channels (it was inspired lol).
